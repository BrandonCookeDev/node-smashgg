/** Patch Notes **/

/** 1.0.2 :: 01-30-2018 **/
* Refactored errors on SmashGG Object instantiation to emit an 'error' event coupled with an Error object.
* Refactored the simple getters to no longer return a string on null, but instead to Winston log the error.
This should make the getters more dev friendly
* Refactored the simple getters to all reference a similar function since they're all doing the same thing,
unless they return an object property
* Included changes to overall docu. Added a section about integrating a Winston log file.

/** 1.0.1 :: 01-29-2018 **/
* Included the github repository in package.json
