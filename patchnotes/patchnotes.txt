/** Patch Notes **/

/** 2.0 **/
# MAJOR
* Added Convenience methods to Tournament, Event, Phase, and PhaseGroup
These functions now return Promises that resolve the respective expected object. 
'ready' event will now be deprecated.
* Event
* Altered Tournament, Event, Phase, and PhaseGroup constructors to now implement an options object
This options object now consumes the previous isCached and expands parameters
Options object now includes optional rawEncoding parameter allowing for space optimization by storing raw data in base64 or utf8 string
* Added fuinctions to get Date objects back from date getters in SmashGG objects, 
alongside getDateString methods that return the strings from V1

# MINOR
* Altered some logic that pulls bulk data like Players and Sets to be more optimized for async/await
* Now verbose log all smashgg api urls use in object creation
* All smashgg objects now have convenient toString methods
* Better error handling for non-existent smashgg objects coming back with 404s
* Added sample2 which uses convenience method
* Added eslint for format linting

/** 1.0.6 **/
* Added ability for Event to take an ID for an event. 
At the end of the constructor, an optional ID can now be added. 
The rest of the params can even be null.
* Added unit test capability for this addition, but it needs to be
really fleshed out. However it proves the functionality works.

/** 1.0.5 :: 02-01-2018 **/
* Fixed documentation for Set constructor.
* Added section to README about submitting issues or feature requests.

/** 1.0.3 :: 01-31-2018 **/
* Updated documentation with a Table of Contents. Fixed incomplete example in Tournament docs.

/** 1.0.2 :: 01-30-2018 **/
* Refactored errors on SmashGG Object instantiation to emit an 'error' event coupled with an Error object.
* Refactored the simple getters to no longer return a string on null, but instead to Winston log the error.
This should make the getters more dev friendly
* Refactored the simple getters to all reference a similar function since they're all doing the same thing,
unless they return an object property
* Included changes to overall docu. Added a section about integrating a Winston log file.

/** 1.0.1 :: 01-29-2018 **/
* Included the github repository in package.json
